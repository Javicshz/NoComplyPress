# NoComplyPress - Getting Started & Learning Together

Welcome to the beginning of our project.

This is a space for us to learn, build, and experiment with code, design, and tools we’ve never used before. Whether we’re working with Python, HTML, CSS, or Git, this is about **growth at our own pace** not speed or perfection.

## Our Philosophy

We’re going to run into a lot of things we don’t fully understand at first. That’s normal. In fact, that’s the **whole point**.

- We’ll use **ChatGPT** often, and we should **never hesitate** to ask it for help.
- Every time we generate or find code, we should **ask ChatGPT what it does**, line by line.
- We should treat ChatGPT the same way we’d ask a real person for help ask follow up questions, be specific, and try things out.
- The more we work with tools like this, the **less we’ll need to rely on chatgtp** in the long run.

> This is not a race. We’re not on a deadline. We move at our own pace and make things we enjoy.

## Key Tools We'll Use (and Learn)

These are the tools, languages, and platforms we’ll get familiar with as we build NoComplyPress. You do not have to read all of these but if you are curious what it is or want to read more info than these are here for you to learn from. You will however need to download VS Code & Python and later MySQL. I would suggest reading the Markdown sources.

## Reminders & Tips

Learning by doing is how this works. It’s totally fine to:
- Break stuff
- Rewrite it
- Ask "dumb" questions
- Get stuck
- Start over
- Talk to yourself like you're crazy as you work
- Create a "Project" folder" in chatgtp to keep track of your conversations with chatgtp related to the project
- If my explaination doesn't make sense in any of my documents then I advise you to watch a youtube tutortial or ask chatgtp

That’s the whole process.
